New features:

1) The design spec only uses a small portion of the data for each track which the API supplies. 
Add columns for more information. The list might get wide enough to scroll horizontally.

2) The numbers in the "Listeners" column can be hard to read. For example, numbers like 50421 and 1029333 could benefit 
from an improvement in their numerical formatting.

Use a JavaScript library to improve the numerical formatting of this column. -> http://numeraljs.com/

3) On many apps, when a user finishes typing in a search box they can use the "Return" key, a.k.a. "Enter", 
to submit their search. Implement this in your app.

4) Animate the title text, "trackster", between the time the user clicks the search button and the time that the song list 
is displayed.

5) Allow the user to sort the columns by any attribute of the track information by clicking on the corresponding column.
